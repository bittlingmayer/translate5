One sentence in advance: 

If you do not like our license model: We are convinced Open Source
people and open to other Open Source license models. The license model below is the result of
having to respect the Ext Js license. You are welcome to sponsor legal advice, than it might
be possible to release translate5 in accordance with Ext Js license also under licenses like
EPL or LGPL.

A copy of this license you can find at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html or

The "translate5 Editor Javascript GUI" (which can be used together with the 
"translate5 PHP Server") uses the ExtJs 4 lib from Sencha, which is also
licensed under the terms of the Open Source GPL 3.0 license. More about the ExtJs license
you can read on http://www.sencha.com/license. For translate5 you are allowed to make
use of the same FLOSS exceptions as specified by Sencha for ExtJs. 

These exceptions are:

* Open Source License Exception for Applications

  http://www.sencha.com/products/floss-exception.php or 
  in the same folder than this document in the document floss-exception.txt.

Please be aware, that Marc Mittag / MittagQI take no warranty for any legal issue, that 
may arise, if you use these FLOSS exceptions and recommend to stick to GPL 3.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An exception to this license are the external software-libs, used by translate5. 
If you use them, you must follow and apply their specific licenses. Therefore they 
are not part of the translate5 software package and not part of the translate5 
git-repository.

These external software-libs are:

- Ext Js. It is needed for the translate5 Javascript GUI and is also
licensed under the terms of the Open Source GPL 3.0 license and allows the FLOSS-exceptions
listed above. More about the ExtJs license you can read on http://www.sencha.com/license.

- the MittagQI-fork of Horde_Text_Diff. It is used by the diff-Version of the translate5 export,
which is able to track the changes made in segments. If you use this functionality, you
need the Horde_Text_Diff-package. Horde is licensed under LGPL v. 2.1. A copy of 
the LGPL v. 2.1 you can find at http://www.horde.org/licenses/lgpl21

- the MittagQI-fork of restful-zend-framework. restful-zend-framework is 
Copyright (c) 2011 Code in Chaos Inc. http://www.codeinchaos.com. In our opinion 
it's license is compareable to a free-bsd-license (no warranty or responsibilty 
for this opionion in any way by MittagQI or Marc Mittag in person). You find this 
license at https://github.com/MittagQI/restful-zend-framework/blob/master/LICENSE
Without this software-lib "translate5 PHP Server" will not work.

- the MittagQI-fork of XliffTermTagger. XliffTermTagger is developed by Prof. Dr. Klemens Waldhör,
Heartsome Europe GmbH. XliffTermTagger is multilicensed under Eclipse Public license and GNU
Public License 3.0. A copy of these licenses you can find on 
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html and http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html or in the same
folder as this document.
If you use the terminology-functionality of translate5 you need XliffTermTagger.
