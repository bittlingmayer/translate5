    <h2>translate5 issue tracker</h2>
    <p>Any ideas for new features, higher level feature stories or bugs are kept in translate5 JIRA issue tracker., which is publicly available.</p>
    <p>We plan to set this up at http://jira.translate5.net/ and enable you to create your own user to submit your own issues. Currently a bug at Atlassian (the company behind JIRA) keeps us from migrating. </p>
    <p>As long as this is not fixed, you will be able to access the translate5 JIRA at <a href="https://mittagqi.atlassian.net" target="_blank">https://mittagqi.atlassian.net</a></p>
    <p>Without login you can view all issues.</p>
    <p>However you can login any time using the user "translate5" and the password "translate5" and create issues. Please do this only if you are really sure, that you have discovered a bug or have a great idea for a feature, which is NOT listed so far in the JIRA. If you are not sure, please contact us by e-mail at support __att_  translate5.net instead of posting in the JIRA. Thank you!
    <h2>translate5 source code on bitbucket</h2>
    <p>The last major release of translate5 is always <a href="%s" target="_blank">published on bitbucket</a>. A new major release is published at least every half a year.
</p>
<p>Regular minor releases more early contain new features and necessary bug fixes. Minor releases are available to everyone with a <a href="%s" target="_blank">maintenance and support contract</a> with MittagQI.</p>
<p>translate5 is spread over multiple Bitbucket repositories and also requires a number of external libraries. The top repository is "translate5", which contains the dependencies as submodules or references.
