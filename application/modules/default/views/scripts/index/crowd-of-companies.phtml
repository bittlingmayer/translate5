    <h2>Being flexible &amp; master of your processes</h2>
    <p>Many companies wish, they would be able to develop their own software:</p>
    <ul><li>For optimal adjustment to their customers needs</li>
        <li>For being able to serve the best quality</li>
        <li>and for optimizing their productivity.</li></ul>
    <p>Yet for many this is not possible due to resources.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal of the translate5 project is enable companies to fulfill those needs.<br>And jointly build and maintain that system with the power of the crowd.</strong></p>
    <h2>Building a crowd of companies</h2>
    
    <p>Through <a href="#crowdfunding">a crowdfunding (see below)</a> translate5 reached the state, that it can serve as a cloud translation tool (in addition to being a review tool since 2012).</p>
    <p>Thus the next phase started to bring translate5 as a cloud and community-based translation system into existence: <strong>Building a crowd of companies, that commit to start using translate5 as a translation tool in daily business.</strong> And together complete, what still is needed.</p>
    <p>By joining the crowd of companies you can help to pave the way for a wide spread use of a tool, that</p>
        <ul><li>you can extend and integrate as you need it</li>
            <li>allows as many users as you want</li>
            <li>and allows to set and propagate open standards in the industry.</li></ul>
        
    
    <h2>Joining the crowd of companies</h2>
    <p><strong><a href="mailto:support@translate5.net">So contact us if you would like to see that happen</a>.</strong></p>

        </li>
