    <h2 class="important" style="margin-top: 0;">A web-based free software translation system is approaching!</h2>
    
    <p><strong>For the first time in translation industry</strong> a modern, cloud-based and community based Open Source translation system is approaching :-)</p>
    <p><strong>Unique:</strong> The system</p>
    <ul>
        <li>is fully Open Source</li>
        <li>is based on a growing community of small &amp; mid-sized companies</li>
        <li>is NOT produced by an LSP, but by independent Open Source developers</li>
        <li>is backed by LSPs, MT providers and TMS providers alike</li>
        <li>is modern, cloud-based, fast, easy extendable &amp; easy integratable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong><a class="important" href="/login">Try it!</a></strong>
    </p>
    <p>Still there may be features, that need to be developed for your needs to use it. This gets easier with every company, that joins the community.</p>
    <p>The most essential steps, that still need to be developed (and get financial or development support) are 
    <ul><li>converting source file formats to XLIFF (by integrating Okapi)</li>
        <li>and analyzing files for potential matches to make quotes (by integrating the corresponding features of OpenTM2)</li></ul></p>
    <p><strong><a href="/index/join" class="important">So join the community of companies</a> working together on Open Source and thus keeping their independence!</strong></p>
    <p>The major goal of the campaign is to join efforts in creating a modern community-based Open Source Translation system that meets the major needs of Language Service Providers.</p><br>
