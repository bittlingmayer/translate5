    <h1>translate5 windows installer: Download and install it now!</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            In English language only.
        </p>
        <p>
The installer uses just 5MB - and you do not need any IT-knowledge to use it. 
Just a few clicks- and translate5 installer will load all needed components from the internet and install them for you. 
        </p>
        <p>
Since extending translate5 with your own plugins and upcoming community plugins is one of the strong points of 
translate5 (and true community Open Source in general), even external components integrated in translate5, 
like openTMStermTagger, can be handled by the installer.
