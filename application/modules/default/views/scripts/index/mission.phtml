<h1>translate5 mission</h1>
    <h2>Collaboratively develop the software that companies, freelancers and MT-researchers need</h2>
    <p>Many translation companies, translation departments, freelancers and MT-researchers are technically skilled. They know what they want and expect from their software.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal of the translate5 project is to give the control over the software they use to its users.</strong></p>
    <p>It's about being independent, it's about being able to use, extend and integrate their software in the way they need it. And it's about being in control over your software.</p>

    <h2>Joint development: the conceptual base</h2>
    <p>The language industry is becoming more technically complex.</p>
    <p>For small- and medium-sized companies and language departments, joining development forces with others to develop the software they need will become an important factor in maintaining independence from the big players of the language industry.</p>
    <p>For MT- researchers it is extremely helpful to be in close cooperation with companies using translation software in business - and to engage in common software development. Translation professionals benefit from inputs of MT- research in development and translation processes.</p>
    <p><strong>The conceptual basis for these needs is joint development based on Open Source.<br><br>Studies show, that many of the most successful companies cooperate with their competitors.</strong></p>
    <p>This concept is akin to the concept of other Open Source community projects in the language industry,  most notably <a href="http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/" target="_blank">Okapi</a> (basic framework and suite of tools) and <a href="http://omegat.org/" target="_blank">OmegaT</a> (desktop translation tool).</p>
    <p>The translate5 project aims to cooperate with these and other Open Source projects wherever possible. As a web server environment, translate5 aims to serve as an API-based integration hub for many different tools (both Open Source and proprietary) to help users enjoy the combined power of different tools in an easy-to-use GUI.</p>

    <h2>Why Open Source</h2>
    <p>Open Source is free software. It is free in the sense of &quot;no cost to use&quot;, but its main idea is &quot;freedom&quot;. Users are free to do what they want with the software - integrate it, extend it, develop it -  as long as they respect the Open Source license.</p>
    <p><strong>This gives users security for their business: They will be able to rely on the software no matter what happens to any company backing it. They always will be able to find someone to support or develop it.</strong></p>
    <p>In addition to that, the freedom of Open Source enables software to attract much more attention from both users and contributors than closed source software can.</p>
